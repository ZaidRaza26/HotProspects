### Application to track who you meet at conferences, it will show a QR code that stores your attendee information, then others can scan that code to add you to their list of possible leads for later follow up.

### It includes tab bars and context menus, sharing custom data using the environment, sending custom change notifications, and more

### The gif below is from the simulator so test data was added but if you run the application on a real device it will automatically open Scanner.
